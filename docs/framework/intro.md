## The Future of the Framework
We are in the process of adding versioning to the External Module framework to allow full backward compatibility while leaving room for growth.  The framework version is incremented whenever breaking changes are required, and those changes are only implemented in that new version.  This gives module authors the freedom to decide if/when they would like to update their modules in order to gain access to new features.
