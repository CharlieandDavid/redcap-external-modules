## Framework Version 5

See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- Earlier framework versions provided `getProjectSettings()` and `setProjectSettings()` methods which each were broken. The first returned copies of system-only values as if they were project values, and the second simply did not work (it did nothing). Both have been fixed in this framework version. `getProjectSettings()` now returns project settings **only**, in a format that is different from earlier framework versions (`key => value` instead of `key => ('value' => value, 'system_value' => systemvalue)`).
- If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.
