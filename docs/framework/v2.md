## Framework Version 2

**This framework version is DEPRECATED for new modules, and upgrading is recommended for existing modules.**  See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for the latest framework version and more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes
* A `framework` member variable is now automatically added to the module class that will house all future methods.  If any modules previously defined their own `framework` member variable, they will need to be refactored to use a different variable name instead.
* Calling `$module->framework->getSubSettings()` will return slightly different output than calling `$module->getSubSettings()`.  The framework provided version handles complex nested settings much more accurately, but has some subtle differences preventing full backward compatibility with the method directly on the module class.
