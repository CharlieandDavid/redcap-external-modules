## Framework Version 2

#### Breaking Changes
Framework version `2` adds a `framework` member variable to the module class that will house all future methods.  Any modules that previously defined a `framework` member variable by the same name will need to be refactored to support this framework version.

#### Methods
Accessing [Version 1](v1.md) methods the way we always have is still considered good practice (at least for now).  The following new methods can be accessed via the `framework` object (e.g. `$this->framework->getProjectsWithModuleEnabled()` or `$this->framework->records->lock()`).

Method  | Description
------- | -----------
**getProjectsWithModuleEnabled()** | Returns an array of project ids for which the  current module is enabled (especially useful in cron jobs).
**records->lock($recordIds)** | Locks all forms/instances for the given record ids.
