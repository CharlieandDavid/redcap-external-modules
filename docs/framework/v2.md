## Framework Version 2

#### Breaking Changes
* A `framework` member variable is now automatically added to the module class that will house all future methods.  If any modules previously defined their own `framework` member variable, they will need to be refactored to use a different variable name instead.
* Calling `$module->framework->getSubSettings()` will return slightly different output than calling `$module->getSubSettings()`.  The framework provided version handles complex nested settings much more accurately, but has some subtle differences preventing full backward compatibility with the method directly on the module class.

#### Methods
Accessing [Version 1](v1.md) methods the way we always have is still considered good practice (at least for now).  The following new methods can be accessed via the `framework` object (e.g. `$this->framework->getProjectsWithModuleEnabled()` or `$this->framework->records->lock()`).

Method  | Description
------- | -----------
getProjectsWithModuleEnabled() | Returns an array of project ids for which the  current module is enabled (especially useful in cron jobs). 
getSubSettings($key&nbsp;[,&nbsp;$pid]) | Returns the sub-settings under the specified key in a user friendly array format.  In most cases the project id can be detected automatically, but it can optionally be specified as a parameter instead. 
records->lock($recordIds)** | Locks all forms/instances for the given record ids.
