## Framework Version 3

See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for more details on framework versions in general.

Framework Version 3 was first added to REDCap in Standard Release 9.1.1. It first appeared in REDCap LTS at 9.1.3.

#### Breaking Changes

* The convention for the **icon** parameter for links specified in config.json has changed to expect [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) icon classes (ex: `fas fa-receipt`) instead of a REDCap image resource name. A path to an icon filename in your module may also be specified (ex: `images/my-icon.png`). All link icons will need to be updated when switching to this framework version.
* If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.

#### New Features

* This framework version introduces **internationalization support** for external modules. Module authors can make their modules "translatable" by including a language file (such as _English.ini_) that contains key/value pairs (exactly as the REDCap core language files). Translatable text is output by the new `tt()` function. Please refer to the [internationalization guide](../i18n-guide.md) for more details.
