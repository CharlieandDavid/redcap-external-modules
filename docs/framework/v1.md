## Framework Version 1

**This framework version is DEPRECATED for new modules, and upgrading is recommended for existing modules.**  See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for the latest framework version and more details on framework versions in general.

The REDCap External Module framework was first added to REDCap in Standard Release 8.0.0. It first appeared in REDCap LTS at 8.1.2. This version of the External Module framework was rebranded as _Framework Version 1_ when Framework Version 2 was released.

Since each module's main class extends **AbstractExternalModule**, the following built-in methods are available.  They can be called by using **$this** (e.g., `$this->getModuleName()`).
